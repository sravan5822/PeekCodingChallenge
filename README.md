# PeekCodingChallenge

Created a small ios application that queries Github to get repositories that mention GraphQL. Used pagination with 5 results for each page along with following details:\n
The name of the repo\n
The owner login name\n
The owner avatar\n
The number of stars\n

As provided in the initial sample, used Appolo cocoapod to query Github for graphql mentions. Used MVVM design pattern along with custom tableview cell and models.
