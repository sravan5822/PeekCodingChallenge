# PeekCodingChallenge

Created a small ios application that queries Github to get repositories that mention GraphQL. Used to pagination with 5 results for each page along with following details:
The name of the repo
The owner login name
The owner avatar
The number of stars

As provided in the initial sample, used Appolo cocoapod to query Github for graphql mentions. Used MVVM design pattern along with custom tableview cell and models.
